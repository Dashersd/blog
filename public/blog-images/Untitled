This Friday, we began working on the feedback and suggestions given by our supervisor. We carefully reviewed each comment and identified the areas that needed improvement, particularly in the system’s design and functionality. As a team, we divided the tasks and focused on implementing the necessary changes to enhance the overall performance and usability of the system. This process helped us better understand the importance of accepting feedback and applying it effectively to improve the quality of our work.
