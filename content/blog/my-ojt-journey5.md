# My First Day of Duty at the NCIP in 2026

On my first day of duty at the NCIP, I arrived at the office feeling both excited and motivated. After settling in, I organized and set up my personal belongings and workstation. Once everything was ready, I was oriented on my tasks and immediately began working on coding for the NCIP system requirements. This experience marked the beginning of my hands-on involvement with the organization’s technical processes and helped me become familiar with the working environment.

# Second day of Duty

The second day was much busier compared to the first. We focused on making significant progress on the Online Job Application system because we were scheduled to present it to our supervisor on Thursday. This presentation was intended for consultation and to gather her feedback and suggestions regarding the system we were developing. The tight schedule motivated us to work more efficiently and collaboratively to ensure the system was ready for review.

# Another Day of Duty

On this day, we traveled to the Buenavista Campus to meet our Dean and instructors to secure their signatures for our Memorandum of Agreement (MOA), which is an important requirement for our On-the-Job Training. Upon arrival, we respectfully approached them and explained the purpose of our visit. They warmly accommodated us and reviewed our documents before signing them.

After completing the necessary paperwork, we took the opportunity to take selfies as a remembrance of the day. We also had a short but meaningful conversation about our OJT experiences, including the tasks we had been handling, the challenges we encountered, and the lessons we learned along the way. Our instructors gave us encouragement and advice, motivating us to continue working hard and improving our skills. This day was memorable as it strengthened our confidence and reminded us of the support we have from our academic mentors.

# Clutch Time at Work

This day was a crucial moment for our team as we fully focused on system development. It was truly “clutch time” since we were preparing to present our system to our supervisor later for confirmation. We carefully reviewed the design, functionality, and overall performance of the system to ensure everything was working properly. Our main goal was to finalize the features and make sure the system met the required standards.

As we prepared for the presentation, we remained attentive to possible feedback, including any suggested changes or improvements to the design or system functions. This experience taught us the importance of teamwork, time management, and attention to detail, especially when working under pressure and deadlines.

After presenting the system, our supervisor provided constructive feedback and pointed out several areas that needed improvement. Although there were some changes required in the design and certain system functions, they were still manageable and within our capabilities. We carefully noted her suggestions and discussed them as a team to determine the best way to implement the necessary revisions. This process allowed us to improve the overall quality of the system and ensure that it better met the intended requirements. Despite the pressure, we remained motivated and confident, viewing the feedback as an opportunity to enhance our skills and produce a more efficient and user-friendly system.

# Friday’s Progress

This Friday, we began working on the feedback and suggestions given by our supervisor. We carefully reviewed each comment and identified the areas that needed improvement, particularly in the system’s design and functionality. As a team, we divided the tasks and focused on implementing the necessary changes to enhance the overall performance and usability of the system. This process helped us better understand the importance of accepting feedback and applying it effectively to improve the quality of our work.
