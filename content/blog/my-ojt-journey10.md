*Strengthening Face Recognition Logic*

Today, I focused on improving the face recognition comparison process. I worked on refining how the system compares the live face with the stored reference image and how the similarity score is calculated.

I realized that recognition is more sensitive to lighting and positioning than I expected. This reminded me that real-world AI behavior is not always perfect and requires proper handling and user guidance.

*Enhancing User Feedback*

Today, I improved how the system communicates results to the user. I refined the status messages, confidence display, and visual indicators to make everything clearer and easier to understand.

Small UI changes, such as color adjustments and better label placement, made a noticeable difference. I learned that even strong AI features need clear presentation to feel polished.

*Handling Edge Cases*

Today, I focused on scenarios where the system might fail or behave unexpectedly, such as low light conditions, multiple faces appearing at once, or sudden camera interruptions.

Testing these edge cases helped me think more like a developer preparing an application for real users. It made me realize that stability is just as important as functionality.

*Performance Tuning*

Today was all about optimization. I adjusted detection intervals and reviewed how frequently the model runs to prevent unnecessary resource usage.

I noticed smoother performance after limiting some processes. This experience strengthened my understanding that efficiency and balance are key in real-time AI applications.

*Reviewing Overall Progress*

Today, I stepped back and reviewed the system as a whole. From camera setup to face detection, recognition, and emotion analysis, I could clearly see the progress made since the planning stage in January.

Although there are still areas to improve, I feel proud of how far the project has developed. This reflection reminded me that consistent effort, even in small steps, leads to meaningful results.![2.PNG](/blog-images/1772069630967-2.PNG)
