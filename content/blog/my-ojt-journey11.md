*Starting a New Project (Aurelia)*

Today, I started a new project called Aurelia, and my goal is to create a luxury-style jewelry website with a clean and elegant look. I wanted this project to feel premium, modern, and smooth—something I can be proud to include in my portfolio.

I began by working on the landing page experience, especially the Hero section. I focused on the first impression: animated background details, soft glow effects, and smooth text animations to make the page feel alive.

While building this, I reminded myself to keep the design beautiful but still lightweight, because too many animations can affect performance.

*Expanding the Brand Identity*

After starting the Aurelia project on February 16, today I focused on giving the website more depth and identity. I built the About Aurelia section and carefully crafted the brand story to make it feel elegant and meaningful.

I used smooth scroll-based animations so the content reveals naturally when users scroll down. At this point, the project started to feel more like a real luxury brand instead of just a design experiment.

*Showcasing the Collection*

Today, I continued developing Aurelia by creating the Featured Jewelry section. My goal was to make each product card feel interactive and premium.

I added hover animations such as image zoom, shine effects, animated borders, and subtle sparkles. While testing, I realized that balance is important—too many effects can distract users, so I refined the animations to feel smooth and elegant.

*Bringing Everything Together*

Today, I worked on completing the overall page structure by adding the Call To Action and Footer sections. I designed the CTA to clearly invite users to explore the collection while keeping the visual style consistent with the luxury theme.

Adding the footer with navigation links and social icons made the website feel complete and structured. By the end of the day, Aurelia had a clear flow—from Hero section to brand story, product showcase, and final call-to-action—which made me feel proud of how the new project evolved within just a few days.![4.PNG](/blog-images/1772239484524-4.PNG)
