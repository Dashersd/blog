### Development Phase 

Last week, we consulted Mrs. Nodarty regarding the system that we are going to develop, entitled “Online Job Hiring System.” During this consultation, we presented our initial concept and discussed the purpose of the system, its target users, and the key features that need to be included. Mrs. Nodarty provided valuable feedback and suggestions, which helped us refine our ideas and better understand the project requirements.

After the consultation, we started creating wireframes to visualize the system’s layout, navigation, and overall user flow. These wireframes served as a guide in identifying the necessary pages and functionalities, such as job posting, applicant tracking, and user profiles. Once the wireframes were finalized and all required components were confirmed, we proceeded with the development of the user interface (UI).

In designing the UI, we focused on creating a clean, modern, and user-friendly design to ensure ease of use for both employers and job seekers. We carefully selected colors, typography, and layout structures to enhance readability and accessibility. This stage allowed us to transform the approved wireframes into a more interactive and visually appealing design. Overall, this process helped us establish a solid foundation for the system before moving forward to the development phase.
