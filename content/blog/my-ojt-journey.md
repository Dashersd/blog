### My OJT Journey at NCIP
Starting my On-the-Job Training (OJT) at the National Commission on Indigenous Peoples (NCIP) has been an incredible learning experience. This opportunity has allowed me to apply my academic knowledge in a real-world professional environment.

### First Impressions
When I first arrived at NCIP, I was excited but also nervous about working in a government office setting. The environment was professional yet welcoming, and my supervisors were supportive from day one.

### Orientation 
Since its our 1st day at the office Atty. Idiang give us a brief orientation on what we should do at the office.

### Divide Groups 
Since we are two groups with three members each, we were divided according to the systems we needed to develop. Harra, Hadjara, and I were assigned to work on the System Development requested by Atty. Idiang. Meanwhile, Johannah, Hasmin, and Trisha were tasked to create the Monitoring System needed by Atty. Idiang’s colleagues

### Consultation 
After the Groupings Harra, Hadjara and I consult Atty. Idiang system. She told us the she she wanted to have a Job Hiring Application for online. For easy monitoring the qualifications of the applicants. 

### Brainstroming & Wireframes
After the consultation of Atty. Idiang our team started the brainstorming

Thinking every possibilities that we may provide for the system that we're going to develop

###Looking Forward
As I continue my OJT journey, I'm excited to learn more and contribute further to the organization. This experience is shaping me into a more well-rounded IT professional.![1.jpeg](/blog-images/1765538045499-1.jpeg)
