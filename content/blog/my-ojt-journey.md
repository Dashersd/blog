"The second semester officially began on November 24, but unlike other students who immediately returned to their regular classes, our team was still fully occupied with completing our capstone requirements. We spent the week refining our documents, addressing the corrections from our technical panelists, and ensuring that every detail met the required standards before submission.

It was a stressful yet meaningful period—one that reminded us how close we are to earning our degree and how crucial teamwork becomes when deadlines are tight.

Then, on November 28, 2025, my team, Diskar-Tech, and I finally enrolled for the second semester. We even took a picture with our Certificate of Enrollment, capturing both our relief and excitement as we prepared for the next big chapter of our journey: our OJT experience.![3bcf284f-2c6d-42a8-be4e-672e59ce6e06.jpeg](/blog-images/1765571587279-3bcf284f-2c6d-42a8-be4e-672e59ce6e06.jpeg)
