### Pictorial

Today was a memorable day for all OJT students of the CCS Department. It was our pictorial day, and for me, it felt extra special. Moments like these don’t come often—days when we finally get to pause, gather together, and celebrate how far we’ve come. Seeing everyone dressed in our Type A and Type B uniforms made the experience even more meaningful, as it reminded me that we’re all sharing the same journey.

The pictorial was held at the Buenavista Campus, and it became even more memorable with the presence of our teacher and, most especially, our Dean, Dr. Philipcris Encarnacion. It wasn’t just about taking photos—it was about capturing memories, milestones, and the bonds we’ve built along the way. This day will definitely be one I’ll look back on with a smile.
