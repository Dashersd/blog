*Preparing for Implementation*

Today, I started shifting my mindset from pure planning into actual implementation. I reviewed everything I’ve written so far and tried to imagine how the system would come together once I start coding.

I focused on setting realistic expectations for myself. Instead of trying to build everything at once, I reminded myself that starting small is important, especially when dealing with camera access and AI models. I realized that even just getting the camera and face detection working properly is already a big step.

By the end of the day, I felt mentally prepared to begin the technical setup. Tomorrow, I plan to think more about project structure and how to initialize the models in React.

*Thinking About Project Structure*
Today was mostly about organization. I thought deeply about how the project files and folders should be structured so everything stays clean and manageable.

I imagined separating components such as the camera view, detection overlay, and results display. This helped me feel less overwhelmed because the system now feels like a set of smaller pieces instead of one huge task.

I also considered how state should flow in the app, especially for camera status, detection results, and emotions. By the end of the day, I felt more confident that I could handle the complexity once coding begins.

*Facing Performance Concerns*

Today, I spent time thinking about performance and device limitations. Since this project relies heavily on real-time processing, I became more aware of how easy it is to overload the browser.

I reminded myself that smooth performance matters more than having too many features. It’s better for the system to feel responsive than to detect everything perfectly. This mindset helped me accept the idea of limiting frame rates and simplifying visual effects.

This reflection made me more careful and practical in my approach moving forward.

*Revisiting Goals and Motivation*

Today, I took a step back and revisited why I wanted to build this project in the first place. I reminded myself that this system is meant to be a learning experience and a portfolio project, not a production-level security application.

This helped remove pressure and allowed me to enjoy the process again. I felt more motivated knowing that making mistakes is part of learning, especially when working with new technologies like TensorFlow.js.

By the end of the day, I felt mentally refreshed and ready to continue.

*Feeling Ready to Start Coding*

Today felt like a turning point. After days of planning, thinking, and researching, I finally felt ready to start implementing the system.

I reviewed all previous notes and journals and saw how my ideas had slowly evolved into a clear vision. Even though I know challenges will come during coding, I feel more confident now because I understand the system better.

Tomorrow, I plan to begin the actual development process, starting with camera access and basic face detection. Ending this phase felt satisfying because it marked the transition from planning to action.
